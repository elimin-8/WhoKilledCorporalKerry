# XIM - Who Killed Corporal Kerry?
[Github](https://github.com/elimin-8/WhoKilledCorporalKerry)

Features
* Plays a random sound bite from various African media
* Plays calm (ish) sounds when not in combat
* Plays intense sounds when the AI is shooting (if XIM is loaded)
* Syncs the currently playing sound with your squad
* Delay time between sounds being played can be customised in CBA addon options
* Confirmed to work in non-dedicated. Singleplayer is not complete yet, and dedicated is not tested.

Examples
You're with the boys and you're about to charge into a room filled with enemies? How about an [epic war cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ70PZH7m_4)?
You're making your way over to the objective? What about [action is coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=najhMb-N7NM)?

Note
This mod simply runs whenever you connect to a server, no setup or anything needed. However, all the clients and the server need to be running the mod.
This mod works best with my other mod, [X's Immersive Music](https://github.com/elimin-8/XsImmersiveMusic), as XIM allows the mod to determine when you are in combat.
Keys are included.

Licensing
This mod is free software and licensed under the GPL.
Any mods or modpacks (not steam collections) incorporating modified versions of my mod must publicly share their modified source code under the terms of the GPL.

Thanks!
Thank you to everyone in the Arma 3 discord, namely Lou and Dedmen, you guys were a huge help!
Top shagger Adam for asking me to make the mod.

Any questions? Ask 'em down in the comments and I'll do my best :)

Cheers lads.
